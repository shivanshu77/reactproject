# React & TypeScript Dashboard

![Dashboard Mockup](https://gcdnb.pbrd.co/images/hWFN0SFxBBH1.png)

This project is a simple test project using React and TypeScript. My main goal is to bring technologies like React, Material-UI and Recharts together to show how it works and to build a foundation for bigger and more complex projects in the future.

## Ã–zellikler

- **Data Grid**: The data grid created using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) allows you to easily visualize and organize your data.
- **Graphics**: [Recharts](http://recharts.org/) powered charts offer a visually effective way to understand and monitor your data.
- **TypeScript Support**: The project is written in TypeScript and will help you make your code more secure.

## Demo

Demo available on this [page](https://react-dashboard-batukaraman.netlify.app).

## Goals

1. **Modular Structure**: The project offers a modular foundation for blog sites, e-commerce platforms and other similar web applications. Each module is designed to meet different business requirements and can be easily integrated.

2. **Backend Infrastructure**: In the future, this frontend project will be integrated with a backend infrastructure. In this way, users will be able to easily use all the backend functions required for web applications such as database management, user authentication and server-based operations.

3. **Comprehensive Solution**: The project provides an adaptable and extensible solution for a wide range of web application types. It can be used for blogs, e-commerce sites, personal portfolios and more.
